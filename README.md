# BlinkWatch

### Project Description

BlinkWatch is a real-time drowsiness detection system that analyzes eye-blink behavior using MediaPipe FaceMesh, engineers blink-based features, classifies alert vs drowsy states with a Random Forest model, and captures temporal patterns using a TensorFlow LSTM network to trigger smart alarm warnings.
